## v1 Already implemented
1. System Prompt Guardrails — Strong scope-enforcing instructions

2. Few-Shot Examples — To reinforce correct behavior in ambiguous cases

3. Token Limits — Prevents overuse and prompt injection abuse

4. Quota Limits — Tracks daily usage per user/IP

5. RAG Context Injection — Dynamically augments relevant information

6. Logging — Input, response, timings, and metadata are persistently stored

7. Rate Limiting — Prevents abuse via burst requests

8. Test Suite — Covers edge cases and error handling in the Lambda UI

9. Analytics Script — Correlates response latency with token usage

10. Deployment Pipeline — Layer-based build to avoid exceeding Lambda limits


## v2 Optional Enhancements for Production Maturity
1. Authentication / API Key Support
- Issue per-user API keys or tokens
- Enables user-level analytics, abuse control, and personalization

2. Abuse Heuristics / Input Filtering
- Detect profanity, prompt injections, or out-of-scope attempts more explicitly
- Could use a rule-based filter or a moderation model

3. Async Processing / Retry Queue
- For long or unreliable calls (e.g., OpenAI API), use an SQS queue + DLQ fallback

4. UI Enhancements
- Save conversation history
- Highlight retrieved RAG context in the response
- Show token count or rate limit info in debug mode

5. Fallback or Fail-Safe Mechanism
- If OpenAI API fails: show cached response, helpful fallback, or a retry option

6. Semantic Search Indexing Automation
- Regularly re-index your .md sources if you edit them often

7. Monitoring & Alerts
- AWS CloudWatch alarms for high error rate, long latency, etc.
- Email/SNS notifications when Lambda errors spike
